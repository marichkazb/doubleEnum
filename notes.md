## Notes

## Project idea

- __SpaceY__ (name)

### Problem Description

Find new ideas based on Earth technologies to build the next Space generation.
We are looking for exceptional Earth developments with a clear relevance for Space
that promise to have a lasting influence on our daily lives. This can be anything
developed on Earth and adapted to the Space environment such as: Hardware, Industrial processes,
Applications, Business models, etc...

> Anything that we can make here on earth and put it in space. It has to have a clear purpose.
> The only possible limitation is our imagination and knowledge 

### Outcome Key-points

* Profitable (_Viable_)
* Desirability (_Clear market_)
* Feasibility (_Possible_)

### Market Examples

* Earth observation and environmental monitoring
* Mobility and transportation
* IoT/M2M Space connectivity
* __Space exploration__ and the sustainable use of space
* Agriculture, life sciences and health
* Microgravity and materials research
* New and sustainable technologies and services

### Brainstorming Session

* Climate change, monitoring temperature. Heat maps.
* Something hardware related 
* 3D printing (related)
* space exploration(s) 
* sending a _specimen_ (of something) to the 'moon'/space. Make something useful for it.
* [?] the removal of debris from space - space debris or space junk as they do not serve any purpose 
* Different types of debris - payload (fragments from wear and tear/ collisions); mission related objects 
  * Critical to have a check on them as they cause collisions with space stations/ operational satellite
* '_Google Maps_' for space (solar system)? There doesn't seem to be a model for that.
* VR/AR Traveling
* Look for a distribution table of debris sizes
* Put the data of the debris (Size, Speed, Whatever)

**Initial brainstorming outcome**: $\rightarrow$ a space `debris` collecting **robot**

### Space debris collecting robot

$:=$ the concluded topic chosen

## Presentation/slides

* we don't need to stress about the time - we'll make a slide just to show what functions/features we could have implemented if we were given more time.
