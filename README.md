In late 2022, me and my fellow colleagues from the University of Gothenburg
and Chalmers competed in the [ActInSpace](https://actinspace.org/) hackathon.
Having won the **national** round in Sweden, we were invited to the
**international** round in Cannes, France. This repository captures the work we
did during the period of late 2022 to early 2023 as part of the competition.

**Thank you** [Sandvik](https://www.home.sandvik/en/) for the support---read
